I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes! Introducing The Pineapple Fund,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jj0oa/im_donating_5057_btc_to_charitable_causes/,"Hello! 

I remember staring at bitcoin a few years ago. When bitcoin broke single digits for the first time, I thought that was a triumphant moment for bitcoin. I watched and admired the price jump to $15.. $20.. $30.. wow!

Today, I see $17,539 per BTC. I still don't believe reality sometimes. Bitcoin has changed my life, and I have far more money than I can ever spend. My aims, goals, and motivations in life have nothing to do with having XX million or being the mega rich. So I'm doing something else: donating the majority of my bitcoins to charitable causes. I'm calling it üçç The Pineapple Fund.

Yes, donating ~$86 million worth of bitcoins to charities :)

So far, The Pineapple Fund has/is:

* Donated $1 million to Watsi, an impressively innovative charity building technology to finance universal healthcare.

* Donated $1 million to The Water Project, a charity providing sustainable water projects to suffering communities in Africa

* Donating $1 million to the EFF, defending rights and privacy of internet users, fighting for net neutrality, and far far more

* Donated $500k to BitGive Foundation, a charity building projects that leverage bitcoin and blockchain technology for global philanthropy. 

If you know a registered nonprofit charity, please encourage them to apply on the fund's website! While I prefer supporting registered charities, I am open to supporting charitable causes as well. Check out the website :)

# üçç https://pineapplefund.org/ 

All transactions are posted on the website for full transparency :)

edit: **Pineapple Fund does not donate to individuals. Please do not post your addresses or PM.**

"Localbitcoins.com is illegally holding my 9.3 bitcoin on ""escrow"" since may 2015",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98uecl/localbitcoinscom_is_illegally_holding_my_93/,"&#x200B;

**Edit.**

Thanks for all your suggestions and support.

I've received news from localbitcoins, I will update this once the authorities get in touch and decide course of action.

&#x200B;

In may 2015  [/BTC-OTC/](https://localbitcoins.com/p/BTC-OTC/)  scammed me and other 6 persons using bank transfer chargeback which led to my bank account being closed and all my funds frozen for 45 days.  At the time BTC-OTC  was one of the most reputable traders on  Localbitcoins.

I  shortly reported this to localbitcoins.com whitch led to BTC-OTC's account being banned and funds being locked - [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhjCz/37f0ab1fc8.png)  also made a police fraud complaint to the relevant authority in UK

Localbitcoins freezed the funds stating the following in my support ticket  - [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmDT/0a136c253b.png)

Since then I've been actively trying to get my coins with no result receiving only one single reply on my support ticket in 8 months

When contacting Max on linkedin his reply was - [HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmJU/01610eaef4.png)

When contacting Max on reddit his reply was - [ HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmIn/71ff537bcf.png)   nevertheless 6 months passed with no reply on my ticket.

I emailed  Jeremias Kangas (CEO & Founder of LBC)  with no success. Also in my numerous visits at Metropolitan Police with this issue I was advised the same, this is a localbitcoins.com customer service issue not a legal issue.

Police official statement on my complaint   -  [ HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmOd/9045da5342.png)

National Fraud Intelligence Bureau advised  to change my fraud complaint against localbitcoins in order for them to investigate and contact localbitcoins regarding the case.

After 6 months of waiting, Max's reply was - [HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmTD/d93973a8bf.png) , after sharing all the info on both support ticket and email he replied on email   [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmXK/a213a8d27b.png)

I knew this won't go anywhere so meanwhile I found a Metropolitan Police Sergeant specialized in blockchain and cyber-crime that understood this issue and decided to help me by contacting them using the fraud report I made in 2015.

Almost 2 months passed since he contacted localbitcoins (3 times) receiving no reply.

Reason I'm posting this is because  there are other 5 persons in this very situation, also other hundreds based on the posts complaining online.

Now I'm in the process of taking legal action. I've been in contact with over 40 lawyers from Finland, and found only 2 that are looking to take this case and quoted me at ‚Ç¨10.000 to  ‚Ç¨15.000 for civil proceedings,

Finnish Law allows only Ombudsman to initiate  a class action lawsuit so this can be settled only in civil court

If you are a victim of this or you can help please get in touch.",18011,2018-08-21 03:09:26,29
